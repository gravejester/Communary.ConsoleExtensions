function Resolve-PathEx {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
            Resolve-Path extended to also work with files that don't exist.
        .DESCRIPTION
            You can use Resolve-PathEx when you want to handle both filenames and paths in a single parameter in your functions.
            The function returns an object, and includes the resolved path as well as a boolean indicating whether the file
            exists or not. Wildcards are supported for both path and filename.
        .EXAMPLE
            Resolve-Path *.ps1
            Will resolve full path of all files in the current directory with the ps1 file extension.
        .EXAMPLE
            Resolve-PathEx c:\program*\windows*\w*.exe
            Will resolve full path of all exe files beginning with w in any folders of the root of C: that starts with 'progra',
            and all subfolders of these that start with 'windows'.
        .EXAMPLE
            Resolve-Path
            Will resolve the current path.
        .EXAMPLE
            Resolve-Path nosuchfile.txt
            Will resolve the full path of the file, even though it doesn't exist.
